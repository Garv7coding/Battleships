# battleships
This Project consists of all 15 files. Together they form a proto-battleships game where the board is 8 x 8 and one ship / boat is one tile.
The Instructions for the game are:
Battle boats is a turn based strategy game where players eliminate their opponents fleet of boats by ‘firing’ at a location on a grid in an attempt to sink them. The first player to sink all of their opponents’ battle boats is declared the winner."
1. Each player has two eight by eight grids. One grid is used for their own battle boats and the other  is used to record any hits or misses placed on their opponents. At the beginning of the game, players decide where they wish to place their fleet of five battle boats ."
2. During game play, players take it in turns to fire at a location on their opponents board. They do this by stating the coordinates for their target. If a player hits their opponent's boat then this is recorded as a hit. If they miss then this is recorded as a miss ."
3. The game ends when a player's fleet of boats have been sunk. The winner is the player with boats remaining at the end of the game."
4. If you enter a wrong value, the game will break. Enjoy Battleships."
5. To save a Game, press 69 in the middle of the game (during the stage you are guessing the opponent's ships)
